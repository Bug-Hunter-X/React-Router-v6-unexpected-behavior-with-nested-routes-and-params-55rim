# React Router v6 Unexpected Behavior with Nested Routes and Params

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router v6 related to nested routes and parameters.  The issue manifests when navigating to a route that has a child route with a parameter; the child route renders incorrectly or not at all.

## Bug Description

The problem occurs when you have nested routes, and one of the child routes uses route parameters.  Under certain navigation scenarios, the child route may not render correctly or may render unexpectedly.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate between the routes to observe the buggy behavior.

## Solution

A potential fix involves ensuring that the parent route's `element` prop correctly renders its children, especially when dealing with dynamic segments or parameters. The solution file provides a revised approach that addresses the unexpected behavior.
